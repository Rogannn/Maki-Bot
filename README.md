# Maki-Bot
Web-based A.I. Chatbot using NLP with Tensorflow for DHVSU Admission Inquiries


# Current problems occuring when running Maki Bot:
They only appear for certain reasons that can be easily avoided and not have bad effect.
1. When applicant logins using google account, it will trigger a early token warning.

HAPPENED WHEN: When I used ccleaner to clean cache of my laptop

FIX: re-sync date and time


2. When applicant chats with Maki Bot, it will trigger the notify mailing system even if the query of applicant is within the FAQs. This only happens when its the first time running the system after booting up the device.

HAPPENED WHEN: unknown

FIX: Run, stop, and run again the launcher when its the first time running after booting up the computer. Do this only once per boot up.
