# Current problems occuring when running Maki Bot:
They only appear for certain reasons that can be easily avoided and not have bad effect.
1. When applicant logins using google account, it will trigger a early token warning. This problem might only happen specifically on my laptop.

- REASON: When I used ccleaner to clean cache of my laptop, the time gets out of sync a little bit

- FIX: re-sync date and time


2. A function gets triggered for whatever reason.

- REASON: idk

- FIX: When its your first time running the system after turning on your computer, execute the launcher.py two times. Run, stop, and then run again
