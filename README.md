# Current problems occuring when running Maki Bot:
They only appear for certain reasons that can be easily avoided (this might just be happening specifically because of my 8 year old laptop).
1. When applicant logins using google account, it will trigger a early token warning. This problem might only happen specifically on my laptop.

- REASON: If the date and time of the device used to launch is not sync, the token warning will get triggered. My laptop's date and time always gets out of sync whenever I use ccleaner to clean my cache. 

- FIX: re-sync date and time.
